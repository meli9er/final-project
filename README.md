### Press Release:

Enjoy the open road? Want to learn more about what has happened along that open road ? Introducing eMarkers, a new app coming to the Apple Store and Google Play Store. This app encourages increased awareness and access to roadside historic markers.  

Imagine, you’re driving along Route 66. You see a sign indicating that there is a historical marker ahead. Do you stop? Will it be worth taking the time to see it? With eMarkers, you will receive an alert indicating the title of the marker, so you can make a more informed decision. 

With a driver mode (the information will be read out loud), a passenger mode (the information will be shown as text on screen), and an explore mode (all options available) for when you’re planning a trip or a road trip from your couch, eMarkers helps you explore not only the road itself, but what happened alongside it. 

The FEWD-323 Final Project website is meant to illustrate some of the app’s intended functionality once built. The “screen” will change (photo carousel-style) as the user hovers the mouse over each od the four features highlighted on the page.
